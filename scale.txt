'In 1998 the CfA2 Great Wall was discovered. It is a thread like string of galaxies about 300 million light years or 4.7 Yottametres wide. It is about 200 million light years away and, so far, we cannot even observe the ends of the Great Wall. However, this is not the largest structure in the observable universe, the Sloan Great Wall was discovered in 2003 and stretches 1.37 billion light years across or 10 Yottametres.'

'1 Zattametre holds our entire Milk Way galaxy. From Earth we look at it sideways, looking at the disc, edge on.  It appears as a cloudy band but in fact is a series of spiral arms containing about 400 billion stars. These spiral arms, Perseus, Norma, Outer, Scutum-Centaurus, Carina-Sagittarius, and Orion-Cygnus orbit the galactic centre.  We are located in the smaller Orion-Cygnus Arm about 3/4 away from the centre.  It is important to bear in mind that the Milky Way is only 1 of 200 billion galaxies in the universe that we can directly observe.  Surrounding those stars are about 50,000,000,000 planets, some of which may harbour life as ours does. To see the sheer number of stars is overwhelming but more importantly, humbling as we have not reached the end of our journey of scale yet.'

'Omega Centauri is a collection of stars that orbits a central point or galactic centre. This particular globular cluster comprises of about 10 million stars and is 230 light years, or  1.6 Exametres wide. It is 15,800 light years away and is actually part of our Milk Way galaxy.  You can actually see this cluster of stars with your naked eye, if you are in the Northern hemisphere, from around January to May of each year.  During May it is highest point is 10pm and the best way to spot it is to look for Sppica, the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo.'

'This is just the inner core of the Cats Eye nebula at about 1.5pm. 3,300 light years away the central dying  star is spewing out 20 trillion tons of mass per second in what is called a Stellar wind. Why the concentric rings have formed is unknown as is why they are so evenly spaced. Why there is so much structure centrally in terms of bubbles? We do not know. We can approximate, estimate and theorize but many lifetimes will pass before we can every journey there.'

'Eta Carinae is a stellar system comprising of two stars. It spans 1 Terametre in width and is swathed in cloud of red dust called a nebula.  Now that white dot is not the Earth, but the sun in comparison in terms of size. The Earth cannot even be seen. Carinae is 8000 light years from our Sun or Sol. We have already passed all the planets of our solar system and are heading into deep space. That means it would 8 years travelling at the speed of light, c or 1080 kilometres / 671 million miles per hour. As of the year 2011, C.E. or Common Era, the SR71 Blackbird aircraft travels at 2,200 mph and the space shuttle travels at 17,320 miles per hour.\r  Light travels at 186,000 miles per second, 1,1160,000 miles per minute (x 60),  6,696,00,000 miles per hour (x6).  If light travels 6,696,00,000 miles per hour in a year it will travel:  6,696,00,000 x 24 (day) x (365.25) = 5,869,713,600,000 miles.  1 light year = 5,869,713,600,000 miles.   In 8 years it will travel 8 x 5,869,713,600,000 miles, or  46,957,708,800,000,000 miles   For the space shuttle to travel 46,957,708,800,000,000 miles to Carinae it would take:  Space shuttle travels at 17, 320 miles per hour,  415,650 miles per day (x24), 1,518,27,120 miles per year (x365.35).  46,957,708,800,000,000 miles / 1,518,27,120 miles =  30,928,406.47 years or 31 million years to get there.  The largest known star, VY Canis Majoris, is 2.5 Terametres wide. That is 25,000,000,000,000 m, or 25,000,000,000 Km.'

Rivers have become oceans as the world is spartanly divided into blue or green, land or water. The smaller island next to England is Ireland. The land mass to the south is the country of France.
